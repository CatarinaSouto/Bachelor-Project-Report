# EEG Signals During Virtual Reality Control: Gaze Direction and Embodiment on Sensorimotor Activity

This repository contains the final project report for the third-year Bachelor's Project in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Aveiro, completed in July 2025.

## Project Summary

This project explores how **gaze direction** and the **presence of a virtual lower-limb exoskeleton** affect:
- Sensorimotor EEG activity
- The sense of embodiment in immersive VR environments

### Key Findings
- Increased **theta band activity** (especially at C4) was observed when participants looked **downward** or used the **virtual exoskeleton**.
- Subjective reports aligned with EEG results, showing **higher embodiment** and **weight attribution** under the same conditions.

### Experimental Setup
- Participants interacted with a first-person avatar in VR under 4 conditions:
  1. With Exoskeleton, Gaze Downward
  2. With Exoskeleton, Gaze Forward
  3. Without Exoskeleton, Gaze Downward
  4. Without Exoskeleton, Gaze Forward
- EEG signals were recorded using 16 channels, focusing on C3 and C4.
- Analysis included Power Spectral Density (PSD) estimation and statistical testing (non-parametric + repeated measures ANOVA).
